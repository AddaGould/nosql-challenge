# nosql-challenge

As with my previous challenges, whenever I run into an area in the code where I feel stuck I show it to chatGPT and ask for suggestions. Areas where I've directly pulled from chatGPT are noted with a # comment. Unfortunately, I had an issue where the "RatingValue" key:value pair was changed and I couldn't fix it despite replacing the file with a new one or changing my code. I ran with it as if that wasn't an issue (and noted that with a # comment), I'm not sure what else to do.
